# React Theme Toggle Application

This application is a simple React project that demonstrates how to implement a theme toggle feature using React Context and CSS.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files:

- `App.jsx`: This is the root component of the application. It provides the theme context to its child components and contains the logic to toggle the theme.

- `Page.jsx`: This component represents a page in the application. It uses the theme from the context to apply the correct CSS class to the page.

- `Header.jsx`: This component represents the header of the page. It contains a button that toggles the theme when clicked.

- `ThemeContextProvide.jsx`: This file exports the theme context that is used by the other components.

- `index.css`: This file contains the CSS for the application. It defines two themes, `light` and `dark`, which are applied to the page based on the current theme.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the application. It will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

When you open the application, you will see a page with a header and some text. The header contains a button labeled "Toggle Theme". Click this button to switch between the light and dark themes.

## Future Improvements

- Add more themes and allow the user to select from a list of themes.
- Save the user's theme preference in local storage so that it persists across sessions.
